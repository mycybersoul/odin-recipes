        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a lighter, healthier cheesecake with a nutty, slightly sweet crust and a creamy, protein-rich filling. The crust is made from crushed nuts and a touch of natural sweetener, giving it a firm but flavorful base. The filling uses low-fat cream cheese or Greek yogurt, lightly sweetened and flavored with vanilla and optional lemon for brightness. You can bake it or chill it to set, and top it with fresh fruit or a drizzle of dark chocolate for extra flavor. It’s rich and creamy like traditional cheesecake but lighter and less sugary.</p>
